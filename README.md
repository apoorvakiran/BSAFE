# Scientific Analytics For Ergonomics (SAFE)

This is the core data analytics platform of Iterate Labs, Inc. It contains code to parse, analyze, and reason about
data including code for generating results and insights.

The code is structured in a modern, modular, object oriented way to support rapid development, complex analyzes with
an easy interface, and straightforward ways to further develop and expand the code for developers.

## Test
First, to ensure everything is working you will find a simple back-to-back test under "Demos".
This means a test which loads the data, sets up some key objects, and runs some
metrics as well. If that simple test runs then you should be all set.

The specific test file is called "simple_test.py". You run it with:
    >> python simple_test.py

This will help ensure that the code is running as expected after your
clone the repo. There are other tests you can run as well.
