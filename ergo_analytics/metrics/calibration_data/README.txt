This folder contains data used to calibrate the scores.

We view each score as a metric of how severe a given motion is.
For example, the strain score is meant to measure how severe strain is.

But we also have some choices for the parameters that go into each score.
Thus, we can view each score as parameterized. The question then becomes:
Which set of parameters should we choose in order to make the scoring system
perform best against a set of datasets (those contained in this folder).

To put it slightly differently:
Depending on the parameters chosen for each score they can be more or less
sensitive to changes in the motions.
