Thanks for pushing the code forward.

Some thoughts that we have already covered but just to keep documented:

+ Going forward let's utilize git better including branching.
+ Variable naming: Let's be verbose about the names as they are more
descriptive and self-documenting.
+ More documentation/doc-string is better than less.
+ Please have a look at existing (well-tested) libraries like numpy,
scipy, pandas as they typically have already solved many of the sub-problems
we are seeing too (e.g.: bin data is covered well with numpy, no need
to re-invent).
+ More?

Thanks,
Jesper
